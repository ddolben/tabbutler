# Tab Butler

Tab Butler is a browser extension for Google Chrome that does (or is planned to do) all of the things that I believe a tab manager extension should do.

## Installing

Tab Butler is currently not yet available in the Chrome extension marketplace. To install it, follow the directions [here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) for installing an unpacked development Chrome extension.

## Features

* Click to select tab
* Drag and drop tabs between windows
* Close tabs
* Move tab to new window

## Planned Features

* Store tabs in "stored" windows, similar to OneTab and TabCloud. Drag and drop between stored and open windows.
